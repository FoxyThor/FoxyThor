- 👋 Hi, I’m @FoxyThor
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to write programming code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ This is just a hobby for me
- I'm teaching myself and not taking any classes
- I have taken some classes in the past 
- I took a Python class back in 2016 as well as some SQL
- I do have a certificate in graphic design, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Dreamweaver
- I learned HTML5, CSS, a little Java Script in Dreamweaver, and was intrigued
- I'm also learning some Raspberry Pi stuff
- Any advice/help is always appreciated
- And feel free to ask me anything
